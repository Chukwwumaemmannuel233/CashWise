            <p>
              There are a number of reasons the tashs providers will decline a
              tasks and deem it as unsuccessful.
              <br /><br />

              > Always answer honestly-this means we can continue to provide you
              with more tasks that are relevant to you.<br />
              > Complete the task once it's been opened-once you've started a
              task,please don't leave it to comlete later; the task will likely
              'time out' and will be deemed as unsuccessful.<br />
              > Only use one device -make sure you complete a task on the same
              device that you startedit on; if you try and carry on a diiferent
              device, the task provider may class this as 'suspicious activity'
              as it may look like you're trying to complete the same task more
              than once.<br />
              > Use a valid internet connection- if yoou're using a VPN, proxy
              or Tor, please make sure you turn it off before taking a task
              providers are less likely to decline your task if you're using a
              valid IP connecttion.<br />
              > Don't use offensive language-it is not tolerated by our task
              providers and will result in an immediate ban. Some of our
              providers have a zero-tolerancy policy towards fraudulently
              completed surveys and will result in an immediate ban with no
              warning.
